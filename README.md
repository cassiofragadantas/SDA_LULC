# SDA_LULC
Contrastive supervised domain adaptation applied to Land Cover mapping

The proposed approach corresponds to file main_contra_sda.py, combining a batch contrastive loss (NT-Xent) with a domain adversarial training (DANN) and a supervised classification loss on both source and target domains.

Data should be places in a folder (or soft link) 'DATA/' in the project root.
